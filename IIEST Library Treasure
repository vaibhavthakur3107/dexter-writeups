A simple cryptography challenge involving a substitution cipher. 

The Solution: 

    Pattern Recognition: I looked at the ciphertext: Dro pvkq sc ss3cd5_vslbkbi. 
    Identify Cipher: The three-letter word "Dro" looked suspiciously like "The".
         D is the 4th letter, T is the 20th.
         The shift was -10 (or +16). This confirmed it was a Caesar Cipher (ROT10).
          
    Decrypt: I shifted every letter back by 10 positions.
         Dro became The
         pvkq became flag
         ss3cd5_vslbkbi became ii3st5_library
          
    Format: The challenge used leetspeak (3 = e, 5 = s), so I formatted it as requested. 

Flag: root{ii3st5_library}
